### project info

**Autonome Messung und effiziente Speicherung von Industrieroboterbewegungsdaten**

*Automatic measurement and efficient storage of industrial robot movement data*

The objective of this project is to establish the foundation for a robot measurement database capable of storing recorded motion data from industrial robots. By creating a comprehensive database that can continuously grow with new measurement data, various applications and scenarios can be supported, eliminating the need for time-consuming and expensive individual measurements.

The project commenced in September 2023 and is structured around four key milestones:
- Development of a method for comparing robot trajectories, considering position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration deviations across different robot arm configurations and sampling rates.
- Establishment of a database for storing and providing transaction data, emphasizing fast data retrieval and partial sequence search capabilities.
- Creation of a method for sequential test planning for robot path measurement, including the automatic generation of robot programs for autonomous measurement.
- Successful generation of data for the developed methods and algorithms for autonomous measurement, as well as the storage and provision of measurement data.
